# Hospital-Management-System (Java)
- University group project ( 1  year / 2 semester ) 
- java language

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a comprehensive software solution for
managing various aspects of hospital operations, including patient data management, appointment
scheduling, billing, reporting, staff management(doctors). The motivation for this project is to provide
efficient solution for managing a day-to-day operation in a hospital. The health care industry is facing
numerous challenges, such as growing demand for medical services, the need for better patient
outcomes, the requirement for cost containment and the patients time wastage.
HMS aims to provide centralized platform for managing hospital operations, and it can successfully
solve the problems that mentioned above. So, the HMS can effectively manage patients, doctorsâ€™ details,
and the appointment between them like reducing the operational cost and improve the overall
performance of the hospital. Also, it can reduce patient wait times and minimize the time waste,
improving overall efficiency and quality of care in the hospital.
The design of the Hospital Management System takes account into important aspects such as patient
privacy, data security, user-friendliness and lastly the scalability. The system will be implemented using
Object-oriented programming.
The Hospital Management System will consist of 6 classes. The classes are for doctors, Patients,
Appointments, reports, billing, and Hospital itself. Every class has its own responsibility. For an
example, patient class store data about patients and functionalities for generating reports and statics
about patient.
The HMS will improve the efficiency of hospital operations and provide better experience for the
patients and hospital staff. So, the hospital can deliver high quality healthcare service for the patients in
a cost-effective manner. We can improve this HMS with improving the user interface and making it
more user friendly, integrating with other systems like laboratory information systems and also use in
multiple hospitals and interconnect them
